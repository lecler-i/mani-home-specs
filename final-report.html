<h2 id="overall-description">2.2 Overall Description</h2>
<p>The following of this document gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the next part.</p>
<p>The Specific Requirements section, of this document, is written primarily for us and describes in technical terms the details of the functionality of the product.</p>
<p>Both sections of the document describe the same project in its entirety.</p>
<h3 id="product-perspective">2.2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
<p>This system will consist of two parts: one mobile application and one API server. The mobile application will be used to find accommodations and view information about them while the API server will be used for by the mobile application to store and serve the datas.</p>
<p>Since this is a data centric product it will need somewhere to store the data. For that, a database will be used.</p>
<p>The API server will communicate to the database and provide a API Endpoint (HTTP/json) tol provide the mobile application with the datas.</p>
<p>The mobile application will then use the server API Endpoint to get data and modify data. All of the mobile application communications will go over the Internet.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="product-functionality">2.2.2 Product Functionality</h3>
<p>With the mobile application, the users will be able to search for accommodations. The result will be based on the criteria the user inputs. There are several search criteria based on coordinates, price, number of rooms ect… The seach criteria can be empty.</p>
<p>The result of the search will be viewed either in a list view or in a map view.</p>
<p>The list view will have one list item for each accommodations matching the search criteria and show a small part of the accommodation information so the user can identify it.</p>
<p>The map view will show each accommodation location as a pin on the map. In both views the users will be able to access an other screen with complete view of information of a specific accommodation.</p>
<h3 id="user-characteristics">2.2.3 User characteristics</h3>
<p>There are two types of users that interact with the system: - users of the mobile application - accommodation owners</p>
<p>Each of these two types of users has different use of the system so each of them has their own requirements.</p>
<p>The mobile application users can only use the application to find a accommodation and chat with its owner. This means that the user have to be able to search for accommodations, choose a accommodation from that search and then start chatting with its owner. In order for the users to get a relevant search result there are multiple (optionals) criteria the users can specify and all results matches all of those.</p>
<p>The restaurant owners will use the mobile application and be able to search for accommodations like a normal user but will aswell be able to manage the information about their accommodations, for example a description of the accommodation, rent price, type of accommodation…</p>
<h3 id="assumptions-and-dependencies">2.2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
<p>One assumption about the product is that it will always be used on mobile phones that have enough performance. If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example the users might have allocated them with other applications , there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.</p>
<p>Another assumption is that the mobile phones have a available internet connection (via mobile data or WIFI)</p>
<h3 id="design-and-implementation-constraints">2.2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
<p>The mobile application is constrained by the Internet connection of the phone.</p>
<p>Since the application fetches data from the API server over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function.</p>
<h2 id="specific-requirements">2.3 Specific Requirements</h2>
<p>This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the system. It gives a detailed description of the system and all its features.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-requirements">2.3.1 Hardware Requirements</h3>
<p>Since neither the mobile application nor the API server have any designated hardware, it does not have any direct hardware interfaces.</p>
<p>The Internet connection to the API server is managed by the underlying operating system on the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="software-requirements">2.3.2 Software Requirements</h3>
<p>The mobile application communicates with the API server in order to get the information about the accommodations and modifying accommodations (for the accommodations owners and chat messages in general).</p>
<p>The communication between the database and the API server consists of operation concerning both reading and modifying the data</p>
<h3 id="user-interface-requirements">2.3.3 User Interface Requirements</h3>
<p>A first-time user of the mobile application should see the log-in page when he/she opens the application, see Figure </p>
<p>If the user is not a first time user, he/she should be able to see the accommodation listing page directly when the application is opened, see Figure </p>
<p>Here the top-right icon show where the user can click to navigate to the filter page to set search criteras.</p>
<p>The user can apply some search criteras to chooses the type of search he/she wants to conduct, see Figure </p>
<p>From the accommodation listing page, the top-left icon shows where the user can click to access the main menu, see figure </p>
<p>From the accommodation listing or the map view, when the user click on one entry it jump to the accommodation details page for the selected one, see Figure </p>
<p>From the navigation drawer, the user can access the map view by clicking on the “Map” entry where a map of Manipal will be displayed with pins and accommodation description, see Figure </p>

<h3 id="communication-requirements">2.3.4 Communication Requirements</h3>
<p>The communication between the different parts of the system is important since they de pend on each other. However, in what way the communication is achieved is not important for the system and is therefore handled by the underlying operating systems for both the mobile application and the API server.</p>
<h3 id="functional-requirements">2.3.5 Functional Requirements</h3>
<p>This section includes the requirements that specify all the fundamental actions of the software system</p>

<h3 id="performance-requirements">2.4.2 Performance Requirements</h3>
<p>Their is no performance requirements because the system is dependant on the operating system and hardware.</p>
<p>Common best practices on the database queries will be needed but will not have a big impact because the user base is restricted to Manipal only, the system will have a very low charge.</p>
<p>The communication speed from the mobile application to the API server is dependant to the Internet connection (Wifi/Data speed).</p>
<p>Both the mobile application and API server are designed and coded on optimal framework able to handle thousands of request per second, that we will never reached on this phase of the project.</p>
<p>However API server and database are designed in a way that if needed, we will be able to scale them on multiple hosts to ensure large traffic without performance loose.</p>
<h3 id="safety-and-security-requirements">2.4.3 Safety and Security requirements</h3>
<p>Consistency: In case of a potential loss of connection between the mobile application and the API server the owners doing change on their listings, all progress so far is lost.</p>
<p>In case of a potential API server breakdown, the database data (all the accommodations and chats may be lost. A daily backup of the database is done, so any breakdown will result in a rollback of 1day with possible lost of all chats and creation/edit of accommodation for a timespan of the last 24h.</p>

<h1 id="software-design">Software Design</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">3.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The Software Design Document is a document to provide documentation which will be used to aid in software development of Manihone, client and server side, by providing the details for how the software should be built. Within the Software Design Document are narrative and graphical documentation of the software design for the project including use case models, sequence diagrams, collaboration models and object behavior models.</p>
<h3 id="document-purpose">3.1.1 Document purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to outline the software design of Manihome, including the client side (Android application) and an API server side (Elixir/Phoenix). Manihome is an application to help accommodation owner to rent it, and potential tenant to find one in Manipal. That will be developed for our second semester in MIT.</p>
<h3 id="scope">3.1.2 Scope</h3>
<p>This document aims to be a guide for developers to implement the prospective Manihome project. The software will consist of two major components: an application that runs on smartphone which will allow user to post an accommodation for rent, to find one that fit you as a tenant, and being able to communicate with the owner or the potential tenant, and a server application that processes user registration, accommodation form and manage a chatroom.</p>
<h3 id="definitions-acronyms-and-abbreviations">3.1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations</h3>
<p><em>Android</em> An operating system for mobile applications. This is the targeted platform of the mobile app. <em>chatroom</em> virtual place where user can discuss between us. <em>owner</em> user that own accommodation and put an advertisment on Manihome <em>tenant</em> user looking for an accommodation on Manihome</p>
<h2 id="initial-design">3.2 Initial Design</h2>
<h3 id="introduction-1">3.2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>Traditional accommodation rent are often limited to private agencies, word of mouth, and didn’t have a central solution to find the perfect place to live. The Manihome project will use Web and mobile technology brings one and unique place to find the perfect accommodation in Manipal to anybody whose have a smartphone.</p>
<h3 id="technology-used">3.2.2 Technology Used</h3>
<p>The Manihome project is made of 2 parts, the mobile application running on Android, communicating with the API server that manage a database of users, accommodations and chatroom.</p>
<p>Each user need an Android (and IOS later) smartphone for running the mobile application, developed with React-native, a framework for building native application with the power of web technology, more specially React.</p>
<p>The Manihome project also need one server running the API, developed in elixir/phoenix.</p>
<h3 id="system-architecture">3.2.3 System Architecture</h3>
<p>Manihome project is made of two parts, a mobile application, as an interface for users, that communicate with the API Server, which manage data for the project. The required deviced for user is an Android smartphone, the project also need one webThe interface for storing, importing and exporting server to run the server API.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>JWT</em> JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.</li>
<li><em>Auth0</em> Third party single sign on and token based authentication for Facebook and Google authentification.</li>
<li><em>Joken</em> Elixir JWT library (server side)</li>
<li><em>Data Model</em> The interface for storing, importing and exporting all Manihome data.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction-2">3.3.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This document provide an explanation for manihome user interface, first a standard explanation then a interface walkthrough. This document is intented to be read by any user.</p>
<h3 id="user-interface-standard">3.3.2 User interface standard</h3>
<p>When the user launch the application the first time, a login page is shown where he can choose between facebook or google authentification. When is log in, the user access to the application.</p>
<p>The application is made of two main part, a main view and a sidebar view. The user can access to the sidebar view by the main view and he can choose a new render for the main view between:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>List</em> a current list with all availables accomodations, the user can access to the accommodation view.</li>
<li><em>Map</em> a map is shown with the location of all availables accommodations, similar to List.</li>
<li><em>Message</em> a list with all the chat the user is implied in, he can access to a chat view for a given chat.</li>
<li><em>My listing</em> a list with only the users accommodations</li>
</ul>
<p>In the sidebar view, the user can also choose to <em>Log out</em>.</p>
<p>The accommodation view list all the accommodation data and give to the user the possibility to create a chat between him and the owner. The chat view is a typicall chatroom between accommodation owner and potential tendent, where the user can see his message, the other user messages and send a new one.</p>

<h1 id="testing-and-implementation-details">Testing and Implementation Details</h1>
<h2 id="testing-strategy">4.1 Testing Strategy</h2>
<p>The testing approach for this project shall be done in a fashion that will accommodate the current functionality in ManiHome Application and the API.</p>
<p>Functional Unit testing of the source code is set for both the systems on the continuous integration pipeline, preventing a new release in case of fault.</p>
<p>Testing will be designed to encompass the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing will cover functionality testing for the mobile App changes through the use of the test interface. This will validate base functions of the new code as it relates to the standard model of presentation for data and user entered data.</li>
<li>Testing will cover functionalities of the API doing classic functional unit tests and testing the endpoint trough the HTTP protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="levels-of-testing">4.2 Levels of testing</h2>
<p>Testing is done on two levels : - Functional : source code unit testing before deployment in production - Human : on a staging environment, each release of the application is tested by us and some few friends to be sure everything is working correctly.</p>
<h3 id="functional-unit-testing">4.2.1 Functional Unit Testing</h3>
<p>On the two code projects (Mobile App and Server) unit testings are done automaticly on every modifications done to the source code via continuous integration. Using GIT for versioning and Travis-CI for continuous integration, every commits are checked by those.</p>
<p>A release can only be made if all the test are without failure.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions-and-future-work">5 Conclusions and Future Work</h1>
<p>Manihome was the occasion to build a project that offer a proper solution to a real world problem. It was an importunity for us to learn to use the latest technology, having a real deployment suit and imagine what a real world can become, as explain in the following.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-learn">5.1 What we learn</h2>
<p>Manihome being a project from scratch, we took the opportunity to choose new technology in order to update our knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="technicall-aspect">5.1.1 Technicall aspect</h3>
<p>We learn to used new programming language as Elixir, a functional language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM) and its web framework, Phoenix but also using web technology to develop android application with React Native, a framework based on React. To make secured connection between the mobile application and the API server, we learnd to used JSON Web Token, a new way to have secured connection instead of using cookie.</p>
<h3 id="deployment">5.1.2 Deployment</h3>
<p>During all the period of development, we made sure to have a proper deployment environment with git repository and an integration to Travis CI, a continuous integration service that help us to maintain a clean and tested code.</p>
<h2 id="futur-work">5.2 Futur Work</h2>
<p>Manihome is currently a working project, but in order to apply it to real world we need to go further in the communication aspect.</p>
<h3 id="communication-and-business-model">5.2.1 Communication and business model</h3>
<p>First of all, we need accommodation owner in Manipal so that Manihome to make sense. So we need to imporve the communication around this project, especially lending to potential user with sereval accommodations in manipal and agency. Secondly, we need to have a business model. As we want the application to be free for a regular user, we decided to add tax if an user want to propose several accommodations. This way, the application is still free for tenant user and owner with only one accommodation. This way, the application can benefit of a huge community of free account for personal used and having money from paying and professionnal used. We also think about a way to put in priority the accommodations from paying account to let each owner choose to pay or not for advantaged.</p>
