## 1.2 Objectives

Our app goal is to give a platform to find an accommodation in manipal as easy as possible.

For this, we first need to give an easy solution to add an accommodation for rent and find one that can match the potential tenant. In order to achieve that, we implement a simple form to add an accommodation. Each accommodation can be find in a list and also visualise on a map. 

After that, we need a way for tenant to contact the accommodation owner. For that, we implement a chatroom between potentiant tenant and owner. This way, they can contact each other and have an agreement.
