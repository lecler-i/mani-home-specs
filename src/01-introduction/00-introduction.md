# Introduction

Looking for a flat, a room or simply a roomate in Manipal can be a hard task.
Their is only few way to find what you are looking for : by friend telling you, a broker
or browsing some Facebook page deidcated to general buy/sell.

Their is actually no functional website offering a platform to post / browse classified
dedicated to appartment/house renting.

The problem with searching on (more than 5) Facebook pages or contacting one of the 10+ brokers in manipal
is that you will not be able to have some listing of flats matching your criterias,
no such functionalities is available on facebook (you have to browse all the ads and read them to filter out the ones
of interest).

Contacting a broker can be a good solution because you can tell him exactly what you 
are looking for and he will give you a list of available accommodations but it will be
for a cost of a half a month of rent usually.

We offer via ManiHome a very simple application to create your ad or to look for some,
with plenty of search filters and amenities listing that is totally free and easy to use.

It's a market that is literally empty on the internet (brokers doen't have websites)
and their is a huge possibilitie because of Manipal students are big mobile users.
