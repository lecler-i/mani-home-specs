## 1.1 Overview of the proposed system

This paragraph should be a continuation of the introduction done earlier.  It should
indicate the need and implications of the current proposed system.

---

Our project will be a mobile application on Android (later on maybe iOS) platform.
It will need very low maintenance cause the application will be peer to peer, not 
managed by us. We will only to basic moderation and software updates.

Anyone installing the app can browse the listing of available offers and create their
own (like a ebay,olx).

Technically, the system will just need a hosting plan for the database and API.
