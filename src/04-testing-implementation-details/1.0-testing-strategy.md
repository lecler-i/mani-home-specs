## 4.1 Testing Strategy

The testing approach for this project shall be done in a fashion that
 will accommodate the current functionality in ManiHome Application and
 the API.

Functional Unit testing of the source code is set for both the systems
 on the continuous integration pipeline, preventing a new release in case
 of fault. 
 
Testing will be designed to encompass the following

  - Testing will cover functionality testing for the mobile App changes 
  through the use of the test interface. This will validate base
  functions of the new code as it relates to the standard model 
  of presentation for data and user entered data.
  - Testing will cover functionalities of the API doing classic functional
   unit tests and testing the endpoint trough the HTTP protocol.
