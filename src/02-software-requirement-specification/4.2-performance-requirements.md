### 2.4.2 Performance Requirements

Their is no performance requirements because the system is dependant on the operating system and hardware.

Common best practices on the database queries will be needed but will not have a big impact because the user base is restricted to Manipal only, the system will have a very low charge.

The communication speed from the mobile application to the API server is dependant to the Internet connection (Wifi/Data speed).

Both the mobile application and API server are designed and coded on optimal framework able to handle thousands of request per second, that we will never reached on this phase of the project.

However API server and database are designed in a way that if needed, we will be able to scale them on multiple hosts to ensure large traffic without performance loose.
