### 2.2.1 Product Perspective

This system will consist of two parts: one mobile application and one API server. The mobile application will be used to find accommodations and view information about them while the API server will be used for by the mobile application to store and serve the datas.

Since this is a data centric product it will need somewhere to store the data. For that, a database will be used.

The API server will communicate to the database and provide a API Endpoint (HTTP/json) tol provide the mobile application with the datas.

The mobile application will then use the server API Endpoint to get data and modify  data. All of the mobile application communications will go over the Internet.
