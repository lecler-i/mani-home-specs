### 2.2.3 User characteristics

There are two types of users that interact with the system: 
 - users of the mobile application
 - accommodation owners

Each of these two types of users has different use of the system so each of 
them has their own requirements.

The mobile application users can only use the application to find a accommodation and chat with its owner.
This means that the user have to be able to search for accommodations, choose a accommodation from that search and then start chatting with its owner.
In order for the users to get a relevant search result there are multiple (optionals) criteria the users can specify and all results matches all of those.

The restaurant owners will use the mobile application and be able to search for accommodations like a normal user but will aswell be able to manage the information about their accommodations, for example a description of the accommodation, rent price, type of accommodation...
