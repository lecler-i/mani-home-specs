### 2.2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies

One assumption about the product is that it will always be used on 
mobile phones that have enough performance.
If the phone does not have enough hardware resources available for the application, for example the users might have allocated them with other applications , there may be scenarios where the application does not work as intended or even at all.

Another assumption is that the mobile phones have a available internet connection (via mobile data or WIFI)
