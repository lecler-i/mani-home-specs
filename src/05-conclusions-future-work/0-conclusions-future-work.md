# 5 Conclusions and Future Work

Manihome was the occasion to build a project that offer a proper solution to a real world problem. It was an importunity for us to learn to use the latest technology, having a real deployment suit and imagine what a real world can become, as explain in the following.

## 5.1 What we learn

Manihome being a project from scratch, we took the opportunity to choose new technology in order to update our knowledge.

### 5.1.1 Technicall aspect

We learn to used new programming language as Elixir, a functional language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM) and its web framework, Phoenix but also using web technology to develop android application with React Native, a framework based on React.
To make secured connection between the mobile application and the API server, we learnd to used JSON Web Token, a new way to have secured connection instead of using cookie.

### 5.1.2 Deployment

During all the period of development, we made sure to have a proper deployment environment with git repository and an integration to Travis CI, a continuous integration service that help us to maintain a clean and tested code. 

## 5.2 Futur Work

Manihome is currently a working project, but in order to apply it to real world we need to go further in the communication aspect.

### 5.2.1 Communication and business model
First of all, we need accommodation owner in Manipal so that Manihome to make sense. So we need to imporve the communication around this project, especially lending to potential user with sereval accommodations in manipal and agency.
Secondly, we need to have a business model. As we want the application to be free for a regular user, we decided to add tax if an user want to propose several accommodations. This way, the application is still free for tenant user and owner with only one accommodation. This way, the application can benefit of a huge community of free account for personal used and having money from paying and professionnal used. We also think about a way to put in priority the accommodations from paying account to let each owner choose to pay or not for advantaged.
